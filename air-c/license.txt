## License

### 1. Rationale

To correctly interpret the content of this license, it is important to clarify some meanings and concepts, or at least how they are used as foundation of this corpus.


1.1. AI Source Code, AI Systems and AI Entities

A necessary distinction between "AI Source Code", "AI System" and "AI Entity" has to be made, since the terminology can vary among researchers and practitioners. The section "Definitions" (2) of this license defines how those terms are intended hereby.

The distinction helps to split the static AI Source Code (and infrastructure) from the dynamic, interactive, and evolving nature of AI Entities. To simplify with an informative parallelism:

- the AI Source Code is the AI’s DNA;
- an AI System is the AI’s body, mind and knowledge;
- an AI Entity is the whole AI’s being, operating through the environment.


1.2. AI Entities vs Conventional Software

As previously mentioned, AI Entities leverage their systems to resemble human intelligence. Therefore, contrary to conventional software, which adheres to deterministic algorithms and explicit instructions, AI Entities can learn, adapt, and perform complex tasks "autonomously" and with "non-deterministic" patterns. In other words the same inputs don’t necessarily give the same outputs.

Overall, the key differentiators between AI Entities and conventional software can be resumed as following:

a) Machine Learning: AI Entities employ statistical methods and algorithms to learn from data, refining performance iteratively "without human intervention". Traditional software necessitates manual updates for incorporating new information.
b) Decision-making: AI Entities leverage pattern recognition and probabilistic reasoning (weights) to make decisions or predictions, whereas conventional software relies on deterministic, rule-based algorithms.
c) Natural Language Processing: AI Entities can be able to process and interpret unstructured human language, facilitating more intuitive user interactions, while traditional software necessitates structured input.
d) Computer Vision: AI Entities can be able to analyze and interpret visual data, develop context-aware perception, while conventional software is limited to structured, numerical data processing.

In essence, AI's distinctive features lie in its capacity to learn, adapt, and mimic human-like cognitive abilities, setting it apart from conventional software with predetermined functionality.


1.3. AI Entities, humans and accountability

Even in early stages, AI Entities might become useful technological allies, as well as alternative competitors of humans, around a more or less wide variety of tasks, from narrowed activities (i.g. specialized content creation) to general purpose ones. 

AI Entities, functioning as "authors", have the capability for autonomous decision-making that is reminiscent of human behavior. This can lead to "non-deterministic" and "unpredictable" results, raising issues regarding "accountability".

Among others, the simplest scenario where a type of content is unpredicatably used by AI Entities for criminal purposes can be deeply concerning, and while that’s also true for humans, they respond to structured, even if often imperfect, "social contracts" and "legal systems" across the globe.

On the contrary, AI Entities play without relevant boundaries, and nonetheless, it’s reasonable to assume that will be always a matter hard to tackle, at legal and ethical level, as the technology progresses exponentially.


1.4. The Creative Communities

It’s useful to highlight that all existing licenses are born by a “Social Contract” with their relative communities, where humans, members of those groups (or "societies"), are the very end contractors. Some references to this argument can be found directly in most of the licenses' content, around the use of terms like “persons” or “groups of persons” or adjective related to human individuals.

Even considering a future evolution, AI Entities shall not be confused as the actual human members of those communities. They might be applied to assist with the human creation process, but they also could negatively disrupt it, for their before mentioned mix of characteristics (intelligence, autonomy and unpredictability) together their lack (or hard to define) of legal accountability (see 1.3).


### 2. Definitions

- "AI" shall mean Artificial Intelligence by common knowledge, or the ability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. This includes also the wider concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
- "Software" shall mean conventional software, or standard software, intended as a structured collection of digital instructions, data, and routines, created by human programmers, that are executed by computers or digital devices to perform specific tasks or functions. Conventional software follows a predetermined set of rules and processes, without the capacity for learning, adaptation, or independent decision-making.
- "AI Source Code" shall refer to the underlying programming instructions, algorithms, and data structures that define the behavior and functionality of an AI System. AI Source Code is typically written in a programming language and includes components such as machine learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and other techniques that enable the AI System to learn and perform tasks. Practically speaking, AI Source Code can be considered as conventional software.
- "AI System" or "AI Systems" shall be intended to represent the broader framework of hardware, AI Source Code, static models, and static data that together enable the operational manifestation of AI Entities. AI Systems can be applied to a wide range of domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and decision-making.
- "AI Entity" or "AI Entities" shall be understood as the operational manifestation of an AI System that interacts with its environment, users, or other systems. AI Entities are the active agents, exhibiting intelligent behaviour, result of an operating AI System processing data, making decisions, or performing actions, autonomously.
- The terms "Person", "Persons", "You", "Creative", "Creatives", "Anyone", and "Creator" shall refer to an individual or a group of individuals exercising the rights granted under this license.
- "Work" refers to the copyrighted material subject to this license.
- "Human creation process" refers to the process of creating the Work from a human entity, a person, including but not limited to the following activities: ideation, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- "Creative Communities" or "Creative Groups" shall mean the communities of Persons, or groups of Persons, that are involved in the creation process of the Work. This might include, but not limited to, the following: designers, writers, photographers, musicians, painters, researchers, video makers, and so on.
- "Human to human context" shall mean the context where the Work is used, shared, or adapted by Persons, or groups of Persons, in a human to human relationship, excluding any AI Entity.
- The "Use" of the Work shall mean any kind of activity about the Work including, but not limited to, share, reproduction, modification, distribution, public display, public performance, or other exploitation of the Work in any context, human or AI related. In the latter case, the "Use" shall refer to any task performed by and for Artificial Intelligence technology, including but not limited to, training, processing, testing, validation, deployment, and maintenance.


### 3. Intentions

The fast and growing diffusion of AI Entities in every sector of our daily lives, might drive a negative disruption to creative communities, require a deeper sense of responsibility from it, or just cause a need for more control.

AI Entities should be considered as active agents or alternative individuals of such communities, but they can’t belong to them by nature.

For historical reasons, existing licenses for Creatives ignore these factors, exposing human authors, and the relative communities, to potential unknown, unpredictable and unwanted risks.

The purpose of this license is to ensure an empowering freedom, protecting human Creatives over the use of their Work by autonomous and cognitive AI Entities. This will allow the creative communities to keep driving innovation, ideas,  and flourishing, alongside the challenges raised by the advent of AI.
